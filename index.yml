Title-Voltage oscillations in barnacle size muscle fibre with the MorrisLecar Equations

Name-Rahul Mohandas, Gautham Nandakumar

Abstract-Barnacle muscle fibers produce constant oscillations
when their internal medium consist of Ca++ ions.
These oscillations can be abolished if the K+ conductance is blocked/if the Ca++ ions are removed. We aim
to develop a model using Simulink that displays variability in system parameters. We use the Morris-Lecar
equation to model the two systems and analyze its propensity to develop damped oscillations under varying
parameters. It is concluded that a system with two no
activating conductance can exhibit varying oscillatory
behavior
